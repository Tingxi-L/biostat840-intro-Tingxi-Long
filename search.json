    "text": "I’m a first-year Biostatistics master student at Johns Hopkins Bloomber School of Public health.I have a particular interest in the statistical application in drug development and assessment. My goal is to become a biostatistician or data scientist in pharma companies to solve real-world problems such as analyzing clinical trials, real-world studies, etc. I’m also very interested in becoming a developer myself and I hope I can develop open-source packages for biomedical data analysis.\nI attended a Sino-US joint University of Duke University and Wuhan University in China and received my dual-degree of B.S. in Global Health.\nFun fact: I’m also the first undergraduate class of Duke Kunshan University and the first class to graduate from this brand-new University. Very proud to be the very first builder of a University!"
