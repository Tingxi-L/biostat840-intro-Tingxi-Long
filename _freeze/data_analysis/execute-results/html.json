More information about the diversity, salary, income related to US collges can be found in other datasets.\n:::\n\n## Data\n\nSpecifically, we will use the following data from March 2020.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(lubridate)\nlibrary(here)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-tip appearance=\"simple\"}\nTo avoid re-downloading data, we will check to see if those files already exist using an `if()` statement:\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nif(!dir.exists(here(\"data\"))) { dir.create(here(\"data\")) }\n\nif(!file.exists(here(\"data\",\"tuesdata_cost.RDS\"))){\n  tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2020-03-10')\n  tuition_cost <- tuesdata$tuition_cost\n  hist_tuition <- tuesdata$historical_tuition\n  \n  # save the files to RDS objects\n  saveRDS(tuesdata$tuition_cost, file = here(\"data\",\"tuesdata_cost.RDS\"))\n  saveRDS(tuesdata$hist_tuition, file = here(\"data\",\"tuesdata_hist.RDS\"))\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\nLet's load the datasets\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhist_tuition <- readRDS(here(\"data\",\"tuesdata_hist.RDS\"))\ntuition_cost <- readRDS(here(\"data\",\"tuesdata_cost.RDS\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n-   Here is a list of full [data dictionary](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2020/2020-03-10/readme.md#data-dictionary) for what all the column names mean.
